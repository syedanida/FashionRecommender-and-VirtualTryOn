## Key Features

### 1. **Recommendation System**
- **ResNet50** is used to extract meaningful features from images, ensuring accurate and efficient similarity detection.
- Nearest Neighbors algorithm suggests the top 5 most visually similar items.
- Explore various embeddings and feature visualizations like **TSNE** for deeper insights.

### 2. **Virtual Try-On**
- Integrates with the **KlingAI API** to enable virtual try-on functionality.
- Upload your image and a garment image, and let the system combine them seamlessly.
- Process includes real-time task management, image retrieval, and enhancement.

### 3. **Data Exploration and Visualization**
- **Confusion Matrix**, **ROC Curve**, and **Precision-Recall Curve** provide performance metrics for the recommendation system.
- **TensorBoard Dashboards** track training and validation metrics, aiding hyperparameter tuning.
- **SHAP Values** highlight key features driving recommendations, such as color and style.

## Architecture Overview

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for an interactive and user-friendly experience.
- **Backend**: Utilizes **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Sklearn** for feature extraction, recommendation, and performance evaluation.
- **API Integration**: Powered by **KlingAI API** for advanced virtual try-on capabilities.
- **Visualization Tools**: TensorBoard and Matplotlib for insights into model performance and data trends.

### Workflow:
1. **Image Processing**: Leverages ResNet50 to extract robust features from uploaded images.
2. **Recommendation Generation**: Uses Nearest Neighbors to find visually similar fashion items.
3. **Virtual Try-On**: Encodes images, communicates with KlingAI API, and retrieves augmented outputs.

## How It Works

### **Recommendation System**
- Upload a fashion item image.
- The model extracts features using ResNet50 and compares them against the pre-computed embeddings.
- The top 5 visually similar items are displayed with images and links.

### **Virtual Try-On**
- Upload your photo and a garment image.
- The system sends the images to the KlingAI API for processing.
- The combined output is returned and displayed in real-time.
